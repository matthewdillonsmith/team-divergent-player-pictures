# team-divergent-player-pictures
When adding a player picture to this repo, please save it according to the following naming convention:

`lastname_firstname_profilepic.jpeg`

This will make it easier for me to quikcly find pictures and match them to the appropriate team member in the app code.

Also, please make sure that the picture is 250x250 pixels (I will adjust from there if need be).
